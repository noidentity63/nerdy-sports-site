This is my first actual repository and expirimentation with git on my current web project.

"NBArd" is a website project that focuses on attracting new fans into the NBA and educating its existing fanbase. It aims to
provide at least the following functions:

>Presentation of NBA stars and teams in an entertaining yet informative matter;
>Teaching of basic basketball terms to the casual fan; and
>Account-enabled saving of star and team 'favorites'

Data on the stars and teams will be placed in a relational database.
