# nerdy-sports-site
This is my first actual repository and expirimentation with git on one of my current web projects.

**NBArd** is a website project that focuses on attracting new fans into the NBA and educating its existing fanbase. The site name comes from the acronym *NBA* and the word *bard* (a musician, storyteller, or both that travels from tavern to tavern. They were prominent during the Middle ages) The site aims to provide at least the following functions:

* Presentation of NBA stars and teams in an entertaining yet informative matter
* Education in the sport of basketball and more specifically the NBA to the casual fan
* Provision of guidance to the reader in knowing each NBA superstar based on his statistical strengths and weaknesses
* Providing the reader with up-to-date trends in the league

Future plans and features for the project:

* Database reliant information hub similar to a CMS (Content Management System)
* Search function
* User accounts for more specialized browsing

####Languages to be used:
